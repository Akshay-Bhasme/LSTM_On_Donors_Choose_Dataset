## LSTM on Donors Choose Dataset

## Notebook Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Jupyter Notebook implementing "Text Classification using LSTM." This notebook covers the end-to-end process of implementing a text classification model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The notebook is designed to help users understand and apply text classification techniques using deep learning.

## Introduction

This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of text classification using LSTM neural networks. The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature vectorization, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and more.

## Notebook Highlights

- Loading and preprocessing text data: The notebook demonstrates how to load a dataset, perform text preprocessing, and create sequences for LSTM input.
- Word embeddings using GloVe: Pre-trained word embeddings are used to represent words in numerical form.
- Encoding categorical features: Categorical variables are encoded using custom label encoders.
- Building the LSTM model: The notebook uses Keras Functional API to build a multi-input LSTM architecture.
- Training and evaluation: The model is compiled, trained, and evaluated using metrics like AUC score.
- Visualization: The notebook showcases how to visualize the model architecture and training history.

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook using JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the code cells sequentially to understand the implementation steps.
4. Modify the code as needed for your specific dataset and problem.
